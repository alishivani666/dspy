Architecture data : comment centraliser l'ensemble de vos sources de données (CRM, navigation, transactionnelle, offline ...) dans une architecture data marketing pérenne ?\n3. Exploitation : comment exploiter toute la puissance de vos données à travers des segmentations, scoring, machine learning, dans votre stratégie marketing afin d'améliorer vos performances ?\nAu vu de l'état de l'écosystème, qui souffre de plus en plus des mises à jour d'Apple (ITP, ATT), de la fin des cookies actée pour 2024, des différentes réglementations (RGPD, CNIL etc.), nous avons opté pour une meilleure exploitation des données (notamment propriétaires!).

While Neeyah is designed with Muslim Americans in mind, we welcome anyone stuck renting and looking for an alternative path to own a home. We’re redefining the concept of homeownership from the ground up. \\n\\nWhat sets Neeyah apart is our true co-ownership model. We purchase the home together and share in its ups and downs. This means we share in home expenses, profits, losses, and the overall risk of property ownership - all while giving our Residents the opportunity to build equity each month. We are committed to being real co-owners, not just on paper. \\n\\nOur innovative co-ownership approach is backed by real investors. So you don’t have to worry that your co-ownership will be sold off to some bank. We’re in it for the long haul. \\n\\nWhy we started Neeyah: \\n\\nWe’ve always believed in homeownership without compromise.\\n\\nFor years, we waited for an option to own a home without it being a mortgage in disguise—one that involved sharing in profits/losses, risk, expenses, and not selling the ‘partnership’ off to some bank.\\n\\nBut, we got tired of waiting….\\n\\nSo, we built Neeyah—a new way to own a home, debt-free and without a mortgage. We’re on a mission to offer Riba-free home financing tailored for Muslim Americans. With our innovative co-ownership model, we believe we’re on the way to do just that.\\n\\nIt’s been a long time coming, so we’re excited to finally start sharing more about Neeyah and our community.
